# Hypothesis Testing: Flipkart Delivery & Order Analysis

## Project Overview
Statistical validation of Flipkart's operational claims using hypothesis testing in Excel. Analyzed delivery time (5-day claim) and order quantity (2-item claim) using t-tests on simulated order data.

## Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel (Data Analysis ToolPak)
- Statistical Methods (t-tests, p-value analysis)
- Data Simulation

## Key Analysis
- Simulated 1,000 Flipkart orders with delivery times and quantities
- Performed left-tailed, right-tailed, and two-tailed t-tests
- Calculated statistical significance using p-values

## Results
- Delivery time: 4.95 days vs. claimed 5 days (no significant difference, p â‰ˆ 0.19)
- Order quantity: 2.51 items vs. claimed 2 items (significantly higher, p < 0.001)
- Provided data-backed insights for operational strategy and customer behavior analysis
